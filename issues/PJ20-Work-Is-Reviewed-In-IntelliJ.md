# PJ20 — Work is reviewed in IntelliJ

**Status:** soon; a new repository `sokar-intellij`, owned by an agent of its own.

**What must be true.** A developer reviews an agent's waiting work in IntelliJ IDEA, as they would
review a colleague's change: they see what waits, read the diff in the IDE they know, and approve or
reject it - without typing a `git fetch`, knowing a mirror's path, or running anything the agent wrote.

## Why

Today a review happens in the interface, at the command line (`sokar gate review`), or by hand in a
clone with the fetch Sokar prints for a waiting push, opened in IntelliJ's safe mode. The last is the one a
developer wants for real code - but it asks them to copy a command, keep a clone, and remember not to
build. The plugin does those steps for them and keeps the safety the box gives.

## The shape

### 1. A tool window "Sokar", one list of what waits

- Every waiting push of every machine the person reaches, newest first: the task, the repository,
  the agent, how long it has waited, and how far-reaching the change is (Sokar's ranking).
- A notification when something new waits, like a pull request assigned.
- It works whatever project is open in the IDE, or none: a waiting push is reviewed without one.

### 2. Review without a project and without a working tree

- **The plugin keeps a cache of its own per repository**: a bare git repository, with no working
  tree, under the IDE's cache directory (say `~/.cache/sokar-intellij/<repository>.git`). A waiting
  push is fetched there (the fetch Sokar prints, run by the plugin over the person's ssh), never into a
  repository of the person's.
- **The diff is shown in IntelliJ's own diff windows**, which compare two versions of a file without a
  project: the commit list, the diff per file, side by side.
- So a notification can be acted on whatever is open, and **nothing is ever checked out**: with no
  working tree there is nothing IntelliJ could load as a project, sync, build or run - no Gradle or
  Maven import, no run configuration, no `.idea/` file of the agent's. The review writes nothing into a
  repository of the person's.
- **Where the repository is open in an IDE window**, the notification also offers *Open in
  <project>*: it brings that window forward and fetches the push there as `refs/remotes/sokar/<task>`,
  for the IDE's full help (navigation, search). This is the one thing the plugin writes into a
  repository of the person's - a ref, never the working tree - and only when they choose it; the
  review never needs it.
- The files Sokar ranks as far-reaching (build files, workflows, `.idea/`, hooks) come first and
  marked, as in the interface.

### 3. Approve or reject from the window

- *Approve* passes the **full commit id that was shown** (`Approve(… commit)`); a push that moved
  meanwhile is refused (`MovedSinceReview`) and the window reloads it for a new look.
- *Reject* asks for a reason, which reaches the task.
- After approving, the plugin can fetch `origin` so the project sees the forwarded commit.

### 4. How it reaches a machine

- **Through the daemon's own contract**, not the CLI: the same Varlink interface the interface uses
  (`Pending`, `Approve`, `Reject`), over the ssh forward to the machine's socket. The client is
  `sokar-wire`, which `sokar` already publishes for Java - so the plugin speaks the contract with the
  code that defines it, not a copy.
- **Machines come from what the person already set up**: the interface's list of machines and their
  ssh hosts, read only. No second configuration to keep.
- No token, key or passphrase is stored by the plugin: ssh uses the person's agent, as the interface
  does.

### 5. Later, not first

- *Run its tests* on the waiting work, in a fresh container on the machine (B95 `gate try`, F74), its
  output in IntelliJ's run window - never on the developer's computer.
- Starting work from IntelliJ ("let an agent work on this branch") - a separate requirement.

## Building and publishing

- **Built with Gradle and the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin** - the one exception to "a Java
  repository builds through Maven", named in the repository's `AGENTS.md`: JetBrains supports
  building a plugin with Gradle only. As the plugin of `fuinorg/ddd-cqrs-dsl`
  (`intellij/`) is, which also shows the publishing: the plugin zip and an `updatePlugins.xml`
  uploaded to an Artifactory generic repository under `<version>/` and `latest/`, so a person adds
  one URL as a custom plugin repository and installs it from the Marketplace tab.
- **For Sokar:** a generic repository beside `sokar-dist-deb`/`-rpm` (say `sokar-dist-intellij`),
  with the same two channels as the packages: `snapshots` from `main`, `releases` from a `v<version>`
  tag after every check passed (as for the packages). The version line follows the others
  (0.4.0).
- CI as in the other repositories: pinned actions, time limits per job, the plugin verifier against
  the supported IntelliJ versions, and the shared `AGENTS.md` block.

### 6. Settled

- **The IntelliJ versions** are those of the `ddd-cqrs-dsl` plugin: 2026.1 and newer.
- **An agent of its own owns `sokar-intellij`**; the repository and the agent come when this is taken
  up.

## Acceptance

- With the plugin installed from the custom repository URL, a developer sees a waiting push in the
  tool window - whatever project is open, or none - reads its diff in IntelliJ's change view, and
  approves it; the commit arrives at the upstream. Nothing was checked out, built or run on their
  computer, and no repository of theirs was written to.
- A push that moved after it was shown is refused at approval and shown again.
- Reject sends the reason to the task.
- The plugin stores no credential, and works with the machines the person already has.
